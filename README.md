Rescue people from floods:

In any Natural Disaster, the golden period to rescue trapped survivors is between 5 and 10 hours of sudden impact.

The most frequently occuring natural disaster in the world is floods and recent natural disasters in India were floods. 
Our Idea is to tackle this problem in two stages. 

Stage 1- Floods can be Determined by using the social media responses of people from various sources like news,disscusion forums,networking sites.Here a text analytic model can be used to detect flood in an area.The model will determine context from the various sources which are about floods and also anything which is closely related to floods or are the predecessor which eventually cause floods.In Addition to this sudden changes in factors like wind speed, humidity,temperature can also be noted to predict hurricane or heavy rainfall which is one of the major causes for floods. By the end of this stage a broad area/locations have been predicted which will be affected.

Stage 2-Following this a network of economic drones can be deployed in the area of prediction, where computer vision and deep learning algorithms can be used to detect areas of trapped civilians which will help in pin-pointing the location and this will be shown on a map as critical areas where help is needed the most.(This will reduce the diversification of defence personnel used for surveillance and the military and paramedics can focus better as the area is narrowed down significantly).

In conjunction to this, a web platform is available to the public and the defence personnel.People can help the victims by donating money through a payment gateway integrated in the web platform.In this way there is one platform for donations and people can donate without any second thought or hesitation.This platform can also be used as official site to inform the public about the ongoing processes and safety mesasures connected to the natural disaster.
/*
Also if people are trapped and they have their mobile phones with them with connectivity, a message can be sent with location which will be collected to a database. Aggregation of such messages and the maximum messages from a given area can be determined and help can be sent
